Software Security
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client, Artemis Financial, specializes in providing financial services to its customers and needs to develop a secure web application for its customers. This application needs to protect users' personal information and fulfill financial transactions. 


What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
There were a handful of software security vulnerabilities in the original version of the application. I think I did pretty well in updating the denepdency version to the most current one to decrease the vulnerability to zero. Secure coding is a practice that employs technologies to make the application secure and stable. There are many aspects in terms of the importance of secure coding. In my opinion, the primary ones are that it protects sensitive data and protects the application from cyber attacks. In terms of a company's overall wellbeing, software security contributes to the long-term growth of this company. Secured software allows its users to consistantly utilize the software and thus helps the company to generate more income. If there is a lack of software security in the design, there is no longevity of this software, which leads to a waste of money and collective efforts.



What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part of vulnerability assessment was to get rid of all the vulnerable depencencies. In this project, I was able to reduce the vulnerable dependency to one left. Then I suppressed that vulnerable dependency as I assume it does not impact the overall security of the application. 


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by checking and updating the software dependencies, applying SSL and HTTPS mode, and utilizing 512SHA to encrypt certain information. 


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the functionality and security of the software applicaiton, I tested the application on a HTTPS mode to make sure the webpage is displaying desireable results. Once I refactored the code, I conducted another dependency check and found no new vulnerabilities. 



What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
